			The 19th Annual Día del Niño Health Walk and Family Festival celebrated the importance of children and a healthy lifestyle Saturday, April 11, 2015. 
			It was an early celebration of Mexican Children's Day which is April 30. 
			Hosted by the National Museum of Mexican Art, the event began with a 2.1 mile health walk from the museum 
			to the University of Illinois at Chicago Forum. The sun and high-50s temperatures greeted the families. 
			Once at the Forum, the children had the opportunity to get creative with arts and crafts and get active with interactive games.
