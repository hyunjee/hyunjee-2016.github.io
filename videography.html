		For a social media video assignment, I compiled images and videos and reported body image and women's rights issues that were addressed during the 2017 New York Fashion Week. 
		As usual, the final product is not perfect - some scenes needed to be held longer, some needed more action - but it was fun trying to make a quick and engaging video aimed for an audience scrolling through a social media feed.

			With ingredients like Sodium Hexametaphosphate, Sodium Benzoate and Potassium Sorbate, reading the ingredients list on the back of some snacks might conjure memories of chemistry lecture rather than give you a better picture of the food youâ€™re about to eat. Four Northwestern students tried out the more natural versions of lemon iced tea, barbecue chips and blueberry yogurt and compared them to the common versions that have more additives.
		</div>	
		<div class="col-lg-5 line">
			Personally, I try to choose snacks with less additives when the ingredients list is available and the flavor works fine for me. 
			I wanted to see if other students could taste the difference between natural ingredient snacks and the not-so-natural versions, and which they prefer.

		midterms which run into finals week. Some of Northwestern's Happiness Club members share tips on how to survive finals.

		Living on the edge of two, or sometimes even more, borders set by race, mixed race individuals can experience difficulties identifying themselves. 
		Joining the "right" cultural student group that they belong to and being perceived as a person rather than an exotic being 
		are some of the challenges that make them question how to racially identify themselves. However, as the 2010 U.S. Census indicates, 
		more and more people are identifying as multiracial, embracing the experience.
