		Globally, animal agriculture produces 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions while exhaust from all transportation produces 13 percent (FAO 2006). 
		Catering to the global appetite for meat has a much bigger and negative impact on the environment than most people know. 
		In Our Nature challenged some meat lovers to try plant-based imitation meat. Reactions vary, but replacing at least one type of meat seems doable.

		Living on the edge of two, or sometimes even more, borders set by race, mixed race individuals can experience difficulties identifying themselves. 
		Joining the "right" cultural student group that they belong to and being perceived as a person rather than an exotic being 
		are some of the challenges that make them question how to racially identify themselves. However, as the 2010 U.S. Census indicates, 
		more and more people are identifying as multiracial, embracing the experience.
